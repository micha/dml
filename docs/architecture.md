# Architecture (Placeholder)

Authority boundary:

- This document is authoritative only for architecture-document status and
  navigation to the current source-of-truth documents.
- For normative technical behavior, see the spec suite listed below.

This document is intentionally a placeholder while the project is built from
scratch.

For current design and behavior, use the spec suite:

- `docs/spec/overview.md`
- `docs/spec/object-model.md`
- `docs/spec/execution-and-remotes.md`
- `docs/spec/cli.md`
- `docs/spec/python-bindings.md`

A new architecture document will be authored after the implementation structure
is finalized.
