# Architecture (Placeholder)

This document intentionally replaces the legacy architecture write-up while the
project is rebuilt from scratch.

For current design and behavior, use the spec suite:

- `docs/spec/overview.md`
- `docs/spec/object-model.md`
- `docs/spec/execution-and-remotes.md`
- `docs/spec/cli.md`
- `docs/spec/python-bindings.md`

A new architecture document will be authored after the new project layout and
implementation structure are finalized.
