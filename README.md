# DML

Local-first development with lightweight workflow guidance.

## Workflow

The canonical workflow is documented here:

- `AGENTS.md` (Agent guide)

## Build and Test

Build, test, and tooling guidance is being rewritten from scratch.
Use `AGENTS.md` and the active spec docs for current workflow expectations.

## CLI Help

- Primary documentation surface: `dml --help` and `dml <command> --help`
- Optional `man dml` support may be added later from the same help metadata

## Docs

- `docs/architecture.md` (Architecture overview)
- `docs/spec/overview.md` (Specification)
